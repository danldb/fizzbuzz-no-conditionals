# unconditional-fizzbuzz

## The rules

* FizzBuzz is a game that receives an integer and returns a response.
* If the number is divisible by 3, the response should be 'Fizz'.
* If the number is divisible by 5, the response should be 'Buzz'.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the response should be 'FizzBuzz'.
* If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the response should simply be to return the original number.

## The brief

* To develop a game of fizzbuzz in ruby without using any 'if' statements.
* Test driven using RSpec.
